# Final_Project / Project_2_Item Demand Forecasting
# Problem Statement
Demand forecasts are fundamental to plan and deliver products and services. Accurate forecasting of demand can help the manufacturers to maintain appropriate stock which results in reduction in loss due to product not being sold and also reduces the opportunity cost (i.e. higher demand but less availability => opportunity lost). Despite such relevance, manufacturers have difficulty choosing which forecast model is the best for their use case. In this project, historical sales data corresponding to multiple(25) items sold in 10 stores are provided and participants are expected to come up with a best model to predict the future demand for products which results in maximum profit for the manufacturer. Predict the demand for the next 3 months at the item level (i.e. all the stores combined).

# Data
The historical sales data is available here. The item, store and sales details are provided at the daily level for a period spanning 4 years. 

# Minimum Requirements
The end objective of the participant is to produce a model that gives the best prediction to the manufacturer. Such a model must include the seasonality of the items sold.
